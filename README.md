A comprehensive overhaul of Pixelmon to implement Dexzeh's **Run & Bun** ROM Hack.

This mod serves as an all-in-one package that brings the majority of mechanics and game rules from the original **Run & Bun** ROM Hack into Pixelmon. All credit for the core concepts and design belongs entirely to **Dexzeh**.

The purpose of this repository is to provide transparency regarding the contents and functionality of the overhaul mod.
